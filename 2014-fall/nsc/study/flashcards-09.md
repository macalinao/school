### Neural/hormonal: which is longer?
Hormonal -- meters, neural -- millimeters

### Pulsatile
in bursts

### Neural/hormonal spatial extent
Neural -- precise, hormonal -- diffuse

### Tropic hormones
pituitary hormones that affect other endocrine glands

### Releasing hormones from hypothalamus
How pituitary's release of tropic hormones is controlled

### Vasopressin
antidiuretic hormone (ADH) -- raises blood pressure, inhibits urine formation

### Oxytocin
Matenal behavior/bonding. Helps Asperger patiens look at faces and eyes in photographs

### Hypothalamic neurons
Synthesize releasing hormones

### Median eminence/Primary plexus
Where releasing hormones are secreted into

### Anterior pituitary
Where tropic hormones are released due to releasing hormones

### Goiter
Swelling of thyroid due to iodine deficiency

### Cretinism
You become really small after thyroid deficiency. Also results in mental retardation.

### Endocrine pathology
___ mimics psychiatric disorders

### Cushing's disease
Results from long-term excess glucocorticoids, with fatigue and depression (steroids/roid rage)

### Social influence hypothesis
Emphasizes home environment or early seduction as causes of homosexuality

### 4 or 5 years
Age that most homosexuals recall feeling "different". They show gender nonconformity throughout childhood.

### Amount of American adults identifying as LGB
3.5%

### Amount of American adults identifying as T
0.3%

### Are homosexuals common in families where there are homosexual siblings?
Yes; 2-7 times higher

### The same
Male homo/heterosexuals have the ___ testosterone levels.

### Prenatally
When any hormonal influence on male homosexuality likely occurs

### INAH3 (third interstital nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus)
Smaller (Female-sized) in gay men

### Superchiasmatic nucleus (SCN)
Larger in gay men than on heterosexual men, contains more vasopressin-secreting cells

### Anterior commisure (AC)
larger in gay men and heterosexual women than in heterosexual men

### Verbal and spatial performance of gay men
More similar to women's than to hetero men's

### Why do we have sex?
Reproduction, DNA shuffling, fun

### Sex is like hunger and thirst
Involves arousal, satiation, hormonal control, and is controlled by specific areas of the brain

### Sex is unlike hunger and thirst
Not a homeostatic tissue need, and individuals don't require it for survival

### Estrus
State of a woman when they are sexually receptive

### Androgens
Necessary for male copulation

### Sexual response curve
Excitement phase (arousal), In plateau arousal levels off, orgasm, resolution

### Male orgasm brain activity
Primary activation: ventral tegmental area

### Female orgasm brain activity
Activation of deep cerebellar nuclei, inhibition of orbitofrontal cortex

### Medial amygdala
Involved in sex, smell, aggression, and emotions. In the temporal lobe. One subarea is much larger in men.

### Sexually dimorphic nucleus
Males; located in MPOA (medial preoptic area), 2-3x larger in men, male sexual activity related to its size, size depends on prenatal exposure to testosterone

### Ventromedial hypothalamus
Controls receptivity to male advances

### Dopamine (sex) in MPOA
Motivates sex behavior in both sexes, expecially men. DA drugs increase sexual activity. Increasing levels of DA produce erection then ejaculation.

### Serotonin (sex)
Injecting SSRI into LH increases refractory period, impairs sexual ability.

### SSRI
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor -- increases serotonin levels.

### SRY gene
Sex teredmining region on Y chromosome responsible for development of testes. Without it, ovaries form.

### Organizing effects
Mostly occur prenatally or shortly after birth, affect structure and are lifelong

### Activating effects
Occur at any time in life, come/go with hormone fluctuations or are long lasting, but are reversible

### Corpus callosum
Women have larger ones, size of corpus callosum correlates with cognitive skills in women

### Greater asymmetry
In males, better front-back connections. Women are better left-right.

### Verbal ability
Girls

### Visual-spatial ability
Boys

### Physical aggression
Boys

### Affectors of spatial ability
High estrogen level -- depressed spatial ability but enhanced speech/manual skill tasks. Testosterone in 2nd trimester -- increases cerebral asymmetry via accelerated growth of the right hemisphere

### Gender is a continuum, not a dichotomy
True
