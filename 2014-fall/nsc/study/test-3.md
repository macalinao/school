* Mirror neurons -- neurons fire when observing others doing the same task
  * Ventral premotor cortex 
* Extrapyramidal system -- basal ganglia
  * Caudate -- head
  * Putamen -- tail
  * Globus pallidus
* Purkinje cells -- send inhibitory messages
  * In cerebellum
  * Cerebellum guides movement through inhibition
* Movement starts in motor cortex and basal ganglia
  * SMA and cerebellum are later
* Extrapyramidal system predicts postural consequences
  * Acts to prevent loss of balance
* Central pattern generator
  * Neural circuit -- generates rhythmic behaviors
* Input to Output
  * Long journey -- a lot involved
  * Vision -- occipital lobe then premotor/motor then spinal cord under 250ms
* Movement control cascade
  * Current state of the body?
  * Should I move?
  * Select motor plan
  * Load motor plan
  * Execute plan
  * Feedback -- change?
* Strength vs tone
  * Strength is pyramidal (power)
  * Tone is extrapyramidal (posture)
  * Not independent -- pyramidal and extrapyramidal interact with each other
* Pyramidal vs Extrapyramidal
  * Pyramidal damage causes weakness
  * Extrapyramidal damage impairs movement control
* Dystrophin -- protein needed for normal muscle function
  * produced by X chromosome
  * Muscular dystrophy -- progressive degeneration of muscle -- dont make dystrophin
* Myasthenia gravis
  * autoimmune disorder -- patient develops antibodies to own ACh receptors
  * Weakness develops over the day and gets restored with sleep
  * Tensilon (acetylcholine agonist test)
    * With tensilon, myasthenia gravis is fixed temporarily
* Polio
  * Poliovirus destroys spinal motoneurons and sometimes cranial motoneurons
* ALS
  * Amyotrpohic lateral sclerosis
  * degeneration of motoneurons and consequent loss of target muscles
  * Fasciculations -- twitches of muscle fibers
* Spina bifida
  * Spinal cord injuries -- flaccid paralysis -- reflexes, sensastion, and strength below level of injury are lost
* Higher-level (motor processing) disorders
  * Apraxia -- inability to sequence movements, though no muscle paralysis exists
  * Sequencing -- motor planning disorder
* Parkinson's disease
  * A defective gene for alpha-synuclein -- basal ganglia protein -- inherited cause of Parkinson disease
  * Environmental exposures also contribute
  * Degeneration of dopamine cells in substantia nigra -- project to basal ganglia
  * L-dopa precursor to dopamine -- use reduces symptoms
  * Symptoms
    * Tremor
    * Bradykinesia
    * Shuffling gait
    * Postural instability
* Chorea
  * Dancing arms and hands
* Huntington chorea
  * Progressive destruction of caudate nucleus and putamen
  * Cerebral cortex also impaired
  * Gene responsible (HD) has trinucleotide repeat (CAH) variable in length
    * Too many trinucleotide repeats -- disease develops
* Ataxia
  * Cerebellar damage -- impairs motor control
  * Tumors disturb balance (Ataxia)
  * Alcoholism -- gait ataxia; Purkinje cells die
  * Ataxia -- inaccurate movements
* Dystonia (severe)
  * Sustained, patterned muscle contractions
    * Abnormal sustained posture
    * Basal ganglia dysfunction
* Tourette syndrome
  * Tics and OCD
  * Basal ganglia and cortex disorder
  * Coprolalia rare
  * Tics affect face and shoulders more than legs
  * Usually end by adulthood
* Hemiparetic Gait
  * Motor cortex damage such as stroke causes motor impairment
  * Weakness (paresis) of voluntary movements
