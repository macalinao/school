### Izzy
Israel Kamakawiwo'ole - Really fat guy that sang "Somewhere over the Rainbow". Died of heart failure at age 38.

### Homeostatic systems
Use our behavior to keep things balanced

### Negative feedback systems
The main homeostatic mechanisms

### Set point
If a desired this is deviated from, compensatory action begins

### Hypovolemic thirst
Stimulated by low extracellular/intravascular volume.

### Osmotic thirst
Stimulated by high extracellular solute concentration

### Baroreceptors
Detect drop of water volume to activate thirst and salt craving (hypovolemic thirst)

### Vasopressin
Antidiuretic hormone -- reduces flow to the bladder by inducing blood vessel constriction

### Diabetes insipidus
Condition where vasopressin is not produced, resulting in chronic thirst. Dyin of thirst dyin of thirst

### Angotensin II Effects
Blood vessels constrict, circumventricular organs trigger drinking, vasopressin is released, aldosterone is released

### Renin
Enzyme which turns angiotensinogen into angiotensin I, which turns into angiotensin II

### Subfornical organ
Site where circulating angiotensin II acts to signal other brain sites to initiate drinking

### Osmosensory neurons
Located in the anterior hypothalamus; respond to rise in blood osmotic pressure causing release of antidiuretic hormone

### Glucose
Principal fule for energy

### Glycogen
Glucose stored for short term in the liver

### Glycogenesis
Conversion of glucose to glycogen via insolen

### Lipids
Fat tissue, long-term storage

### Leptin
Produced by fat cells to report body fat levels and reduce hunger

### Ghrelin
Appetite stimulant that rises during fasting; drops after eating. Released by stomach endocrine cells.

### Prader-Willi
Condition where you are always hungry. Elevated ghrelin levels are a symptom.

### LH (Lateral hypothalamus) lesions
Causes refusal toeat

### VMH (Ventromedial hypothalamus) lesions
Cause obesity

### NPY/AgRP neurons
Produce neuropeptide Y and agouti-related peptide to stimulate appetite and lower metabolism (weight gain)

### POMC/CART neurons
Produce pro-opiomelanocortin and cocaine- and amphetamine-related transcript to inhibit appetite and raise metabolism (weight loss)

### AgRP secretion inhibitor
Leptin

### Anorexia nervosa
Refusal to maintain body weight, fear of weight gain, body image distrubance, amenorrhea, resticting or binge-eating/purging type

### Bulimia
Recurrent binge eating

### Insula
Part of the brain that is active when you experience disgust

### Orbitofrontal cortex
Part of the brain that tells you when to stop eating

### Basal metabolic rate (BMR)
Energy required to fuel the brain/body and maintain temperature. 75% of energy expenditure in the average sedentary student

### Gastric bypass surgery
Reduces ghrelin and increased PYY and GLP-1, reducing hunger
