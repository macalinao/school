* George
  * Shifted sleep patterns
* Why sleep?
  * Helps avoid predators
  * Saves energy
  * Improves processes that consolidate learned material -- lets us learn
* Rhythms: behavioral, physiological, biochemical
* Components of circadian system
  * Light information goes from eye to SCN via retinohypothalamic path
* Suprachiasmatic nucleus
  * Two proteins bind to form a dimer (clock/cycle)
  * The clock/cycle dimer binds to dna, enhancing transcription of genes for period and cryptochrome
  * Per and Cry bind with each other and another protein, Tau
  * Per/Cry/Tau complex inhibits activity of clock/cycle dimer, slowing transcription of per and cry genes
  * Per/Cry break down, releasing clock/cycle from inhibition and restarting cycle
  * Retinal ganglion cells detect light w/ melanopsin, and axons release glutamate onto neurons in the SCN
* Lesions of SCN
  * Disrupt circadian rhythms
  * Lesions don't abolish infradian or ultradian rhythm
    * Infra -- long cycles like menstruation
    * Ultra -- short
  * SCN regulates pineal gland's secretion of melatonin
  * Light resets clock by suppressing melatonin secretion
* Humans can free run -- work without clock
* Teens hate to get out of bed in the morning (but not kids or older folk)
* Diurnal cycle
  * Morning daylight -- light signals body clock
  * Daytime
  * Evening -- pineal gland converts serotonin into melatonin (Dim light melatonin onset)
  * Night -- 2 hours after DLMO, melatonin floods the blood stream
  * As darkness fades, body stops producing melatonin
* Two types of sleep
  * Slow-wave (nonREM, SWS, stages 1-4)
  * Rapid-eye-movement sleep (REM)
  * Awake -- fast, random, low voltage
  * Drowsy, relaxed -- alpha waves
  * Stage 1 -- Theta
  * Stage 2 -- sleep spindles, K complexes
  * Stage 3/4 -- slow wave
  * REM sleep -- fast, random
* Dreams
  * Dream in REM and non-REM states
  * Vivid dreams occur in REM sleep characterized by visual imagery, sense that dreamer is "there"
  * Nightmares -- awake dreamer from REM sleep
  * Night terrors -- sudden arousals from stage 3 or 4 SWS marked by fear and autonomic activity
* As we age, total time asleep declines, and number of awakenings increases.
  * Most dramatic decline is loss of time in deep sleep
* REM Sleep and Memory
  * Non-REM sleep -- period of recall
  * REM sleep -- consolidation of memory
  * REM sleep -- increases following learning
  * REM deprivation after learning -- reduces retention
  * 60-90 min nap improves learning
  * Replay synchronized w/ hippocampus
    * After 4-7 days memories become independent of the hippocampus
  * Period of memory erasure -- brain purges unwanted memories during REM sleep
* How do I: memorize pathways
  * Wake up
    * Raphe nuclei
    * RAS (brainstem)
  * Fall asleep
    * VLPO nucleus (hypothalamus)
* How am I awake? Brain mechanisms
  * Activity from sensory thalamus to cortex
  * Reticular thalamus inhibits sensory thalamus
  * Brainstem activity controls the thalamus
  * Brainstem cholinergic and noradrenergic networks activate thalamus
    * Directly -- facilitating sensory
    * Indirectly -- inhibiting reticular nucleus
* How do I 'fall' asleep?
  * Firing of activating system in brainstem decreases -- thalamus less activated
  * Inhibition of thalamic reticular nucleus released, increasing inhibition of thalamocortical neurons
  * Thalamus becomes less sensitive to environment and we can sleep
* Do we really need sleep?
  * Sleep deprivation -- irritability, difficulty in concentrating, episodes of disorientation, effects vary with age
  * 20 years old awake for 502 hours
* Narcolepsy sufferers
  * Frequent sleep attacks but insomnia/excessive daytime sleepiness
  * Cataplexy -- sudden loss of muscle tone, and collapse
  * Do not go through long SWS before REM sleep
  * ORexin receptor
    * Narcoleptic dogs -- autoimmune attack on this receptor
    * Appetite, somatomotor activation, vigilance, tachycardia, hypertension
* Sleep disorders
  * Sleep paralysis -- brief inability to move before falling asleep
  * Night terrors and enuresis (Bed-wetting) before SWS
  * Somnambulism (sleepwalking) -- stages 3 and 4 SWS, may persist into adulthood
* Sleep apnea
  * Breathing stops
  * CChest/diaphtagm muscles relax too much
  * Snoring/gasping
  * Apnea arouses the person to breathe but results in sleepiness
* SIDS
  * Sudden infant death syndrome
  * Immature respiratory syndrome
* RBD (REM sleep behavior disorder)
  * Person "Acts out" their dreams
  * Dreams end up in real life
  * Acting out violent, vivid, intense dreams
* Sleep
  * Continued use of sleeping pills, like Ambien
    * Sleeping pills ineffective -- receptor downregulation
    * Change sleep patterns that persist even when not taking the drug
    * Can lead to drowsiness and memory gaps
