* schizoprenia
  * affects 1% of population
  * dissociative thinking, or impaired logical thought, is key symptom
  * Positive -- gained
    * Hallucinations
    * Delusions
    * Excited motor behavior
    * Acute -- more likely to respond to medication
  * Negative -- lost
    * Slow thought and speech
    * Emotional and social withdrawal
    * Blunted affect or emotional expression
  * Cognitive symptoms
    * Disorganized thoughts, difficulty concentrating and following instructions
  * Partially heritable
  * Identical genes; different fates
    * MRI images of twins discordant for schizoprenia
  * Vulnerability model
  * Environmental exposures combine with a person's genetic vultnerability
  * Illness occurs if threshold is exceeded
  * Environmental factures up/downreguate gene function
  * Fundamental characteristic of epigenetics
  * Influenza can cause schizoprenia
  * Reelin stops cells from migrating
  * Cellular disarray of hippocampus in chronic schizophenia
    * It's messed up
    * Pyramidal cells in hippocampus are disorganized in schizophrenia
    * Hippocampus and amygdala are smaller in some schizophrenics
  * Accelerated loss of gray matter in teens w/ schizophrenia
    * underactivity of temporal and frontal lobes -- hypofrontality
    * Loss of gray matter and less metabolic actibity in frontal/temporal lobes
  * Dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia
    * Results from excess synaptic dopamine or increased postsynaptic sensitivity to it
    * D2 levels are higher in schizophrenics in auditory thalamus
    * Neuroleptics -- dopamine antagonist
    * Reducing dopamine produces parkinsons-like symptoms
  * Glutamate hypothesis
    * Underactivation of glutamate receptors
    * PCP -- NMDA receptor antagonist, prevents glutamate from acting normally
    * NMDA receptor underactivation prolonged -- acute schizophrenia emerge
    * Atypical psychotics -- Decrease glutamate reuptake by downregulating glutamate transporter gene, thus giving more glutamate
  * Overactivity of endocannabinoid hypothesis
    * Endogenous cannabinoids act on receptors (CB1)
    * CB1 is an inhibitory modulator of other neurotransmitters
    * EC levels are elevated in CSF of schizophrenics; post-mortem studies show increased CB1 receptor binding
* Depression
  * Symptoms
    * Sad mood
    * feeling wothless or guilty
    * Fatigue/lack of energy
    * etc.
  * Normal Depression
    * Normal reaction to life events
    * "Blue" mood
    * Few other symptoms
    * Short duration (Hours-days)
    * Little impairment
  * CLinical/major depression -- black
  * Brain
    * Increased blood flow to orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala
    * Decreased blood flow to areas involving attention and language
  * Monoamine hypothesis: depression due to reduced synaptic activity of norepinephrine and serotonine
    * MAO inactivates monoamines
    * Treatment with MAO inhibitors raises level of monoamines at the synapse, improves depression
    * Reserpine -- drug which reduces monoamines, can cause depression
  * Antidepressants
    * WOrk via
      * Inhibiting reuptake of 5HT
      * Binding to presynaptic 5HT or NE autoreceptors, thus enhancing neurotransmitter release, or
      * Inhibiting MAO
    * Prozac (FLuoxetine increases neurogenesis
    * Electroconvulsive shock therapy
      * Raises monoamine levels
      * Used in severe depression -- suicidal ideation that requires immediate alleviation
      * Increases sensitivity of postsynaptic serotonin receptors
      * Sensitivity of presynaptic autoreceptors is reduced, increasing norepinephrine and dopamine release
    * Brain stimulation treatment for affective disorders
      * FAst TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation) produces effects similar to traditional ECT
      * Deep brain stimulation of the anterior cingulate gyrus and median forebrain bundle also produces immediate effects
      * Vagus nerve stimulation relieves depression, probably because it increases GABA in the cortex
    * Serotonin hypothesis problems
      * Long lag time between treatment/reduction of symptoms
      * Not everyone is cured or even helped by SSRI meds
    * Which antidepressant?
      * SSRI -- lower severity, more selective
  * Cortisol -- produced by stress
  * Sleep disturbed in depression -- reduced, fragmented
    * Deep slow-wave sleep reduced, fragmented
  * Seasonal affective disorder
    * Mild depression brought on by shorter days of winter/lack of sunlight
    * Phototherapy can suppress melatonin and improve SAD
    * SAD may also respond SSRIs a bit
  * Bipolar disorder
    * Mania -- excess energy and confidence w/ grandiose thinking
      * Less need to sleep, increased sexual drive, and drug abuse
    * Individuals alternate between depression and mania
      * Mania can occur alone, but rarely
      * Psychotic symptoms: delusions, hallucinations, paranoia, bizarre behavior
      * In their 20's
    * Cycling is regular in some and unpredictable in others; cycle length varies from days to months
      * Ventral prefrontal cortex -- Depression switch
      * Ventromedial cortex up to 40% smaller in people who are depressed
      * Neuron number normal, but number of glial cells falls drastically
      * Activity increases in subgenual prefrontal cortex at start of manic period -- bipolar switch
    * Cyclothymia -- mild form of bipolar disorder
      * Cycle between dysthymia (mild depression) and hypomania (increased energy)
  * Anxiety Disorders
    * Intense irrational fears centered on an object, activity, or situation
    * Panic -- fearfulness attacks
    * GEneralized anxiety disorder -- persistence, excessive worry
    * OCD -- obsessions (recurrent and uncontrollable thoughts) and compulsions (rituals)
  * Neurobiology of <blink>PANIC</blink>
    * Serotonin -- supported by efficacy of SSRIs
    * Raphe -- site of 2 major nuclei
      * MRN -- limbic/prefrontal cortex (mediates fear and anxiety)
      * DRN -- prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, thalamus, PAG
        * Modulates cognitive/behavioral components
    * Panic disorder -- temporal lobe abnormalities
      * Small lesions in white matter & dilation of lateral ventricles -- 40% of patients with panic disorder
      * Increased activity of parahippocampal gyrus
      * Decreased activity of the anterior temporal cortex and amygdala, especially on right
  * OCD
    * Obsession is a recurring thought
    * Compulsive individual -- compelled to do repetitive behaviors
    * OCD patients have increased activity in orbital frontal conrtex and caudate nuclei (basal ganglia)
      * Disconnecting orbitofrontal cortex from anterior cingulate cortex provides long-lasting improvement
  * Benzodiazepines treat anxiety
  * Frontal Lobotomy
    * Use an ice pick to cut the frontal lobotomy
