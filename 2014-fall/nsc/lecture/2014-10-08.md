## PTSD
* Develops in response to a streeful event of threatening/catastrophic natre
* re-experiencing, avoiding situations associated with event, hyperarousal symptoms (panic)
* Treatments -- behavioral desensitization
  * Propanolol, ecstasy
* Treatment makes a small difference
* In the long term it goes to like 40% are not cured
* PTSD builds up over a few months

## Stress
* Leads to brain changes and damage
* Frontal cortex & hippocampal volume reduced in combat veterans with PTSD and victims of childhood abuse
* Hippocampal damage due to stress causd by cortisol
* Social/personality influences have a physiological basis
  * Introverts w/ HIV have hgher virus titers than extroverts with HIV
  * could be due to link between introversion & norepinephrine level
* Antibodies are in optimists

## Biological Origins of Aggression
* Aggression -- behavior intended to harm
* 2 types of aggression
  * Reactive -- provoked, emotional, impulsive
  * Proactive -- premeditated, unprovoked, emotionless
* Aggression increases when estrogen and progesterone are low
  * PMS may be reduced by progesterone treatment
  * Testosterone levels higher in males convicted of violent crimes & aggressively dominant female prisoners
* Aggression can increae testosterone
* Testosterone increases after winning sports event, watching one's team win, and even receiving the MD degree
* Tumors in amygdala, hypothalamus or septal area can cause aggression
* Seizure in amygdala increases aggression
* Murderers have higher amygdala/hypothalamus activity
* Removing amygdala reduced aggression in 33-100% of patients
* 13 year old boy
  * Multiple suicide attempts, tried to ride scateboard on freeway, and attempted violent acts on others
  * Placed in restraints up to 6 hours per day
* Reactive and proactive aggression involve different brain areas
  * Murderers lower activity in prefrontal cortex
  * Less gray matter in prefrontal cortex associated with antisocial personality disorder
  * Proactive aggression associated with psychopathy
    * Impaired amygdala, less autonomic response to stress. Consider boston bombers
* 50% of aggression attributed to genetics, so environment is significant
* Socioeconomic drift -- violence begets violence
* Sociopaths incapable of remorse -- commit very violent acts
* Charles Whitman -- kills a bunch of people
  * Got a bunch of violent impulses for some reason
  * Amygdala compressed by a tumor

## Pain
* Ian -- couldn't move unless he was looking at himself
  * Couldn't feel himself
* Receptor stimulus is a graded potential
  * If potential is big enough, it generates an action potential
* How to code intensity of a stimulus?
  * Coding -- patterns of action potentials in a sensory system
* Range fractionation -- different cells have different thresholds for firing over a range of stimulus intensities
* 4 classes of touch receptor -- pain, touch, vibration, strech
* Five touch receptors
  * Free nerve endings -- pain, temp
  * Merkel's disc -- touch
  * Meissner's corpiscle -- touch
  * Pacinian corpuscle -- vibration
  * Ruffini's ending -- stretch
* Temperature receptors use the pain pathway
  * Pain uses 2 types of neurons: 
    * small unmyelinated c fibers dull pain
    * larger myelinated a-delta fibers sharp pain
* Capsaicin -- the hot in chili pepper, activates C fibers via TRVP1 and is neurotoxic
  * Banned in equestrian sports
  * May prevent the growth of some cancers
* Tonic receptors & phasic receptors
* Receptive field -- the part of the world that a sensory neuron responds to
  * Property of a single neuron
  * Differ in size and shape
  * Tongue is most sensitive
