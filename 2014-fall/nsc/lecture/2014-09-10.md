* Some drugs like ldocane can affect the sodium channels in the dendrite,
* We are focusing on the axon terminal.
* Don -- retired accountant
  * Developed tremor, slow movements
  * Diagnosed with Parkinson's disease
  * Takes drug called levodopa to restore dopamine levels -- it helps but it doesn't work after a couple of years
  * The dopamine receptor ropinirole was added to his treatment
  * He becomes a gambling addict and loses over $100k
  * Ropinirole was replaced with monoamine oxidase inhibitor drug -- reports gambling interest has disappeared
  * How can drugs make you addicted to gambling??
* Two receptor subtypes
  * ionotropic and metabotropic
  * They are similar, both receptors in the membrabne, but they respond differently
  * Ionotropic receptors
    * Fast, direct, reliable, boring.
    * Open when bound by a transmitter (ligand gated ion channel)
    * Binds to a cell receptor site in the inside, and when that happens it physically makes the channel get bigger
    * Ligand gated ion channel -- so potassium, chloride, etc can go into the cell
  * Metabotropic receptors
    * Indirect
    * Recognize the transmitter but instead activate g-proteins
    * The binding site is on a membrane boubnd rprotein and that receptor activats a g-protein, where the protein flies to the other ligand gated ion channel within the cell. This is a second habnd, safer way to do the opening of the igand garted ion channel.
