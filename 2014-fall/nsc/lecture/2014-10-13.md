# Questions
* A stroke of the anterior cerebral artery would cause nothing in what?
  * Leg

* thalamus is geometric center of the brain

## Two tactile systems
* One side of spinal cord is pain/temp
* other side is touch vibration etc.

## Somatosensory Cortex -- the Homonculus
* Cortical map represents innervation of a body region
* Somatosensory cortex reorganizes after amputation of a hand
  * phantom limb -- the reorganization is messed up

## Multifaceted character of pain
* Free nerve endings -- respond to temp change, chemicals, tissue injury
* substance P -- neurotransmitter
* Congenital insensitivity to pain -- never feel pain
  * You get damaged
  * Inherited mutated sodium channel in pain fibers in dorsal root ganglia
* Man on Fire
  * Congenital hypersensitivity to pain
  * Cells are firing all the time
  * Severe burning pain whenever it's warm
  * hyperactive sodium channel
* Spinothalamic system transmits pain and temperature
  * Periaqueductal gray involved in pain perception; opioid receptors

## Dr. Livingstone's attack by a lion
* Doesn't feel the shaking

## Summary
* a-delta myelinated fibers are fast, sharp
* C-fibers are slower
* Three channels: will, emotion, sensation
  * Frontal cortex --- make decisions. Should I laugh at church??
  * Sensation -- what does the pain feel like?
  * Emotion -- berserkers
    * Process pain differently
    * Chronic pain syndrome

## Descending pathways (red box) can reduce or increase pain
* The emotions of berserkers --- never even felt it

## Pain can also be blocked in the spinal cord
* Gate Control Theory of Pain
* Gate can be closed by increased activity in A fibers
* A-beta fibers produce touch sensation
* Other factors influence the gate like attention and emotional state

## Pain information is blocked by gating in spinal cord
* Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation delivers electrical pulses to the skin
  * Doesn't work because of "tolerance"

## Other non-drug treatments for pain
* Meditation/prayer
* Acupuncture
* Massage
* Physical activity

## Chronic pain
* Persists even after an injury has healed
* Remains active in CNS for months to years
* Neurogenic pain and psychogenic pain

### Chronic neurogenic pain: Reflex Sympathetic Dystropy
* Normal (stage 1)
  * Touching the skin around your broken bone hurts
  * Trying to guard you from touching that area
  * Localized swelling
  * Usually lasts a few weeks then subsides
* Abnormal (stage 2)
  * Pain becomes more severe and more diffuse
  * Swelling tends to spread
  * Hair and nails become brittle
  * Muscles become to die

### Vicious cycle of neurogenic chronic pain
* Pain keeps triggering more pain

### Remodels the spinal cord
* Neurogenic pain -- inappropriate signaling of pain by neurons
* The touch receptors are remodeled into pain receptors
* Postsynaptic spinal cord neurons take up substance P and remodel their dendrites
* Overactivity of sympathetic input -- increased spontaneous activity and response to all touch

## Sensory Integration Disorder
* Hypersensitivity to touch -- stimulus avoiders
  * Picky eater, only eats certain textures
  * May refuse to walk barefoot on grass or sand -- toe walks
* Hypersensitivity to touch -- stimulus seekers
  * Craves touch
  * Hurts other children or pets while playing
* Synesthesia -- stimulus in one modality creates a sensation in another
  * eg music --> colors
  * Causes: LSD, posterior temporal lobe seizure, blindness or deafness, spontaneous
* Phantom limb pain
  * Rewiring of brain and/or spinal cord
  * Antonio
