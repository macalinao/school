## Questions
* Amblyopia might be prevented by a drug that blocks -- apoptosis
* Hydrocephalus is most likely due to failure of -- none of these

## Migration
* Cells move out from the ventricular layer
* They go to the marginal zone
* Radial glial cells -- guide cells to migrate along
* Neuron wraps around the glial cell to go towards the marginal zone
* pachygyria -- thick gyri
  * Cortex is 6 layers -- this has only 3 layers
  * Everybody is jammed together
  * Child died at a young age -- brain not good
* Chemicals guide axons
  * Chemoattractants -- attract certain growth cones
  * Chemorepellants -- repel growth cones
  * Growth cones -- sensory-motile organelles at tip of growing axons and dendrites
  * Filopodia and Lamellipodia -- outgrowths of growth cones
    * Pull the cones in a particular direction

## Differentiation
* Spinal cord only has to make one decision: sensory or motor?
  * Ventral is motor, dorsal is sensory
* Sonic hedgehog -- protein released by notochord cells that direct cells to become motoneurons
* Induction -- influence of a set of cells on the fate of nearby cells
* You can't change the cell type afterwards

## Synaptogenesis
* Synapses form rapidly in the beginning
* Dendritic tree grows a lot after birth
* Synaptic pruning
  * After a year of age, you have the most synapses you will ever have in your life
  * Afterwards you prune useless synapses
* Fragile X Syndrome
  * Too many synapses

## Neuronal cell death
* Caspases -- proteases that cut up proteins and DNA
* Apoptosis -- starts with CA2+ influx, causes mitochondra to release Diable
  * Binds to inhibitors of apoptosis proteins which nromally inhibit caspases
  * W/o IAP inhibition, caspases dismantle the cell
* Neurons compete for:
  * Chemicals that target cells make
  * Neurotrophic factors
    * NGF -- nerve growth factor
    * Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)
    * Keep neurons alive or help them regrow after injury
    * Travel back up the axon using retrograde transport
  * Synaptic connections
  * W/o enough of both they die

## Sensitive period of development
* Amblyopia -- vision impairment can cause vision loss in an eye

## Autism Features
* Communication/language
  * Delayed language, echolalia
* Lack of social interaction
* Repetitive behaviors, obsessions, and perseveration
* Odd movements
* Predictability
* Intellectual functioning

## Remember Chris?
* Spinal cord can't heal
* Nogo released when oligodendroglia are damaged
  * Prevents the healing
