# Hunger and thirst

## Thirst is first
* Hypovolemic -- low extracellular or intravascular volume
  * Like cutting your artery, sweating, etc
* Osmotic thirst is stiulated by high extracellular solute concentration

## Hypovolemic thirst
* Loss of water volume -- concentration not changed
* Baroreceptors -- detect drop (how streched the blood vessels are)
* Brain activates thirst and salt craving
* Arteries constrict to raise BP
* Causes release of vasopressin -- constricts blood vessels, reducing bladder flow
* Angiotensin cascade
  * Renin (From kidneys) and angiotensinogen (in blood) go together to produce angiotensin I --> 2
    * causing blood vessels to constrict
    * Circumventricular organs trigger drinking
    * Vasopressin released
    * Aldosterone released
* 3 circumventricular organs
  * Subfornical organ
  * Organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT)
  * Area postrema -- vomiting center
 
## Osmotic thirst
* Salt cannot pass through semipermeable membrane
* Cells shrink when there's salt in the blood (extracellular)
* Osmosensory neurons in the OVLT -- respond to rise in blood osmotic pressure
* Tongue contains neurons like this too -- early warning system for the water entering the blood stream

## Diets
* BMR falls at the beginning of a diet to prevent losing weight
* Restricted food intake increases longevity in rats

## Energy Utilization
* Glucose -- principal fuel for energy
* Glycogen -- glucose stored short term in the liver
* Glycogenesis -- convert glugose to glycogen using insulin
* Lipids -- fat tissuea
* Ketogenic diet

## Regulation of Food Intake
* Fat cells secrete leptin

## Ghrelin
* Released by stomach endocrine cellls
* Appetite stimulant

## Why do diets fail?
* Medabolic rate gets lowered
* NPY/AgRP -- stimulate appetite and lower metabolism
* CART -- inhibit appetite and raise metabolism
