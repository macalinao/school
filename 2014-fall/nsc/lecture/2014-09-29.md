# Sex

## CV
* 3 mo old boy. severely constipated, can't hold his head up. does not smile
* prenatal problem

## Neural and hormonal communications differ
* Hormones are gradual
* Pulsatile secretion -- in bursts
* Slow onset but can last a long time
* Some are controlled by circadian clocks

## Loop
* Pituitary gland negative feedback loop
  * TRH tells TSH to be produced
  * Thyroid hormones regulate TRH to stop when theres too much
  * TRH released by hypothalamus, TSH releasted by pituitary

## Psterior pituitary
* Vasopressin -- raises blood pressure, inhibits urine formation
* Oxytocin -- maternal behavior and bonding -- autism?
  * Some autistic kids have a defect in oxytocin production
 
## Anterior Pituitary
* Don't need to memorize the tropic hormones

## Thyroid hormones contain iodine!
* Goiter -- iodine deficiency, thyroid swells
* Small head

## Hormones affect behavior
* Endocrine pathology mimics psychiatric disorders
* Cushing's disease -- long-term excess glucocorticoids
  * Roid rage -- glucocorticoids

## Levels of Sex Determination
* Chromosomal
* Gonadal
* Internal Sex Organs
* External Sex Organs
* Brain Sex
* Gender Identity
* Gender Preference

## Sexual Orientation
* Little support for the social infulence hypothesis
* Biological hypothesis -- feel different as early as 4 or 5 years
* Homosexuality is 2-7 times higher among siblings
* Homo/hetero mailes have the same testosterone levels
* Hormonal influence -- prenatally

## Sexual orientation on the brain
* Bed nuclus of the stria terminals
* Sexually dimorphic nucleus (INH3)
* Suprachiasmatic nucleus
* Anterior commissure -- differs based on sexual orientation
* INAH3 -- smaller in gay men
* Superchiasamatic nucleus (SCN) larger in gay men, contains more vasopressin-secreting cells
* Anterior commissure (AC) larger in gay men, verbal/spatial performance more similar to women's

## Why do we have sex
* Reproduction
* DNA Shuffling
* Fun
* Sex is not necessary, but it involves arousal, satiation, and hormonal control

## Sex and estrogen
* Women don't have estrus


## Sex and androgens
* Too much testosterone is bad
* No testosterone is also bad

## Sexual Response curves
* Excitement, plateau, orgasm, resolution
* Male -- looks like an action potential
* Female -- more complex
  1. Long plateau, like male
  2. Only plateau no orgasm
  3. No plateau, explosive but falls like a cliff

## PET
* Male -- VTA -- involved in orgasm
* Female -- Prefrontal cortex inhibited, activation of deep cerebellar nuclei

## Sex
* Medial amygdala -- Involved in sex, smell, aggression, emotions

## Neurotransmitters
* DA, 5HT

## Biological Determination
* Organizing Effects -- affect structure
* Activating effects -- occur at any time
* Testosterone -- Masculinized and defeminized

## Brain Development
* Corpus callosum -- larger in women
* Men are front-back, women are left-right
