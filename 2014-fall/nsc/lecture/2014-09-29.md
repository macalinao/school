## Neural and hormonal communications differ
* Hormones are gradual
* Pulsatile secretion -- in bursts
* Slow onset but can last a long time
* Some are controlled by circadian clocks

## Loop
* Pituitary gland negative feedback loop
  * TRH tells TSH to be produced
  * Thyroid hormones regulate TRH to stop when theres too much
  * TRH released by hypothalamus, TSH releasted by pituitary

## Psterior pituitary
* Vasopressin -- raises blood pressure, inhibits urine formation
* Oxytocin -- maternal behavior and bonding -- autism?
