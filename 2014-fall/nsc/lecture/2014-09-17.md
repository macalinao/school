# Questions
* Blockage of which neurotransmitter makes the back arch etc? Glycine
* AMPA, NDA, and kainate receptors are acted on by what neurotransmitter? Glutamate
* Extreme microcephaly would be caused by something wrong in: Neurogenesis
* A drug that blocks growth cone formation would impair: migration

## Addiction
* Tolerance -- decreased sensitivity to a drug as a result of taking it
* Sensitation -- increased sensitivity to a drug as a result of taking it
* Addiction -- a psychological construct
* Physical dependence -- caused by withdrawal symptoms (not the reason people continue to take most drugs)
  * Not addiction -- defined by withdrawal
* Psychological dependence -- compulsive and repetitive use, craving
  * Addiction is CRAVING

### What
* Addiction is preoccupation with obtaining a drug
* compulsive use of the drug in spite of adverse consequences
* Behavior phenomenon
* high chance of relapse after quitting
* **Withdrawal** -- negative reaction whe ndrug use is stopped
  * Normally psychological and physical withdrawal symptoms coexist

### Reward
* Reward is the bases for addiction
* Mesolimbocortical dopamine system -- major reward system
  * Test question --- where is dopamine made?

### Addiction and withdrawal are independent
* VTA is involved in addiction
* periventricular gray is not involved in addiction
  * blocking opiate receptors here produces withdrawal

### Learning is important in addiction
* Makes addiction long-lasting; related to brain changes
* increased dendrite length
* If you take heroin in Atlanta instead of in your usual bedroom, your anti-heroin system will not kick in

### Craving
* Causes drug rehab to fail
* Delta FosB -- involved in cocaine addiction
  * slowly builds up in neurons with each drug exposure
  * remains activated for years after last exposure
  * Delta FosB is meant to help neurons learn, but cocaine hijacks it
  * causes structural changes in nucleus accumbens, perpetuating craving

### Pharmacologic treatment strategies
* Agonistic treatments
  * Methadone for opiate addiction
  * Nicotine patches
  * Partial agonists -- replaces the drug
* Antagonistic treatments block drug effects
  * Opiate addiction -- naltrexone
  * Alcohol addiction -- baclofen
* Aversive treatments cause unpleasant reactions when drug is used
  * Antabuse

### The future
* Anti-drug vaccines
* make antibodies against nicotine

## Brain development
* RIP Chris
* Brain grows until you're in your teens, then begins to shrink until you die
* Human brain development
  * forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain
  * Ridge is gyrus, groove is sulcus
* Tuberous sclerosis -- there is no external cortex
  * causes the face to get red

### 6 stages of nervous system development
* Neurogenesis -- mitosis produces neurons
* Cell migration
* Differentiation
* Synaptogenesis
* Neuronal cell death
* Synapse rearrangement

### Neurogenesis
* Microcephaly -- not enough neurons produced
* Mitosis produces neurons around the neural tube

### Cell migration
* Cells move away from the neural tube
* Double band cortex -- the neurons didn't all get to their destination
* Neurons who stay make more neurons. Neurons who leave go on to differentiate

### Differentiation
* you know what this is
* neuron, oligodendrocyte, astrocyte

### Synaptogenesis
* Create synapses
* Autism -- make wrong connections

### Neuronal cell death
* Delete neurons that are not useful

### Synapse rearrangement
* Make the correct connections
