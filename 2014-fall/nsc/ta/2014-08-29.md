* Know the case studies!

## 3 types of neurons
* Unipolar neurons transfer electrical impulses the fastest -- pain example
* Bipolar neurons -- found in teh retina of the eyes
* Multipolar neurons -- one axon and many different dentrites; most common type (95%) Like voting

* Dendrites are input, axon terminals are output

## Flow of information through a neuron
* input zone --- dendrites
* integration zone -- information is compiled and a decision is made
* conduction zone -- transmit through the **axon**
* output zone -- transferred to other cells

* **Axon hillock** -- region between the cell body and the axon, where the information begins to be transmitted

## Glial cells
* Astrocytes -- hold the neurons in place
* Supplies neurons with nutrients via astrocytes
* Microglia clean up the dying neurons and glia
* Ependymal cells line the vesicles and secrete/absorb cerebral spinal fluid
* Oligodendrocytes -- coat axons with myelin sheaths
  * MS -- failure of oligodendrocytes to cover the axons with myelin
  * Exist in the central nervous system mostly

## Dendritic spines
* Form from experiences
* Basis of learning new things and experiencing new things
* Neural plasticity very involved

* CNS is the brain and spinal cord
* PNS includes cranial nerves and spinal nerves and everything else

## Sympathetic and parasympathetic activation
* Parasympathetic is the normal balance of the body
* Sympathetic is flight or fight
* These are always on all the time, but balance each other out
  * For faster response -- if something happens you can switch right away
* **Don't need to know what areas have to do with what part of the spinal cord for this class**

## White vs Gray matter
* White matter is white because it is a collection of axon bundles with myelin sheaths
* Gray matter is the cell bodies

## Four lobes
* Frontal, parietal (top), occipital (back), temporal (bottom)
* Know sylvian tissue and central sulcus

## Mid and lower brain
* Reticular formation -- primary controller of sleep and arousal
  * Comas -- problems with this
* Pons -- motor and sensory nuclei in your face
* Medulla -- heart rate and breathing

## Meninges
* Dura mater -- most protective layer
  * Bleeding under -- subdural hematoma
* Arachnoid membrane -- supportive layer
* Pia mater -- covering layer, thinnest, cannot remove without damaging the brain

## Ventricles
* Produce CSF
* Made of ependymal cells
* Hydrocephalus -- when cerebral aqueduct is blocked

## Neocortex
* Cortex has 6 layers, more layers may appear over time
* Your cerebral cortex
* Pachygyria -- when brain fails to develop the 6 layers of the neocortex

## Neuroimaging
* CT scan -- xray, detects the density, cheaper
* MRI scan -- detects the fluids, bone appears black
* fMRIs show brain activity -- changes in brain metabolism and oxygen ussage
