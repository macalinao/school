* The covariance of X and Y
  * Measuures the degree of linearity
  * Depends on the unit of X and Y
* Correlation coefficient -- to standardize the measure independent of units, Cov(X, Y) is divided by SDx and SDy to obtain r.
  * sign relation +/-
  * strength -- also range, -1 to 1
  * r range - -1 to 1
  * 1 -> straight line
  * -1 -> straight line (-)
  * 0 -> no correlation
