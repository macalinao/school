# Chapter 3: Alkanes
* Alkane -- hydrocarbon that only contains single bonds
* alkene -- double, alkyne -- triple, rings -- aromatic
* **saturated** -- maximum number of bonded hydrogens. Alkanes are the class of saturated hydrocarbons.
* Alkene notation: H-(CH2)n-H
* Nomenclature: (prefix)ane
* homologous series -- series of compounds that differ only by the number of CH2 groups. 
* **Homolog** -- member of the homologous series
* Formula: CnH2n+2

## Nomenclature
* meth, eth, prop, but have historical routes
* Pentane on uses the greek word for the number of carbon atoms, + ane
* Straight chain: n-butane or just butane
* Isopentane and neopentane are **common/trivial names**, as in names arising from common usage.
  * Cannot describe more complicated molecules
* IUPAC -- International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry
* **IUPAC names** or **systematic names** -- the names we use to name compounds today
  * Rule 1: find the longest continuous chain of carbon atoms: this is the base name of the compound
    * **substituents** -- groups attached to the maintain, substituted in place of a hydrogen atom on the main chain
    * Choose the chain with the least substituents
    * Number from the end nearest the branch so the numbers of the carbons will be as low as possible
