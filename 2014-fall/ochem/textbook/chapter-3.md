# Chapter 3: Alkanes
* Alkane -- hydrocarbon that only contains single bonds
* alkene -- double, alkyne -- triple, rings -- aromatic
* **saturated** -- maximum number of bonded hydrogens. Alkanes are the class of saturated hydrocarbons.
* Alkene notation: H-(CH2)n-H
* Nomenclature: (prefix)ane
* homologous series -- series of compounds that differ only by the number of CH2 groups. 
* **Homolog** -- member of the homologous series
* Formula: CnH2n+2

## Nomenclature
* meth, eth, prop, but have historical routes
* Pentane on uses the greek word for the number of carbon atoms, + ane
* Straight chain: n-butane or just butane
* Isopentane and neopentane are **common/trivial names**, as in names arising from common usage.
  * Cannot describe more complicated molecules
* IUPAC -- International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry
* **IUPAC names** or **systematic names** -- the names we use to name compounds today
  * Rule 1: find the longest continuous chain of carbon atoms: this is the base name of the compound
    * **substituents** -- groups attached to the maintain, substituted in place of a hydrogen atom on the main chain
    * Choose the chain with the least substituents
  * Rule 2: Number from the end nearest the branch so the numbers of the carbons will be as low as possible
  * Rule 3: Name the alkyl groups
  * Rule 4: Organize multiple groups like di- tri- etc

## Physical Properties of Alkanes
* Hydrophobic
* Boiling point increases depending on how many carbon atoms there are
* Melting points also increase with molecular weight; however, the graph is not smooth
  * Even numbers of alkanes need higher temperatures to melt
* paraffins -- another term for alkanes
* combustion -- converts alkanes to carbon dioxide and water
* cracking -- produces smaller hydrocarbons
  * without hydrogen, creates mixtures of alkanes and alkenes
* hydrocracking -- hydrogen is added to give saturated hydrocarbons
* halogenation -- uses heat or light to add halogens

## Conformations
* ethane -- has conformers along the C-C sigma bond
* Newman projections -- draw a molecule looking straight down the bond
* Ethane has infinite conformers
* sawhorse structures -- look down at the bond at an angle
* dihedral angle -- angle between the C-H bonds on the front carbon atom and the C-H bonds on the back carbon
  * 0 -- eclipsed, highest energy
  * 60 -- staggered, lowest energy
  * anything else -- skew
* resistance to twisting -- torsional strain
* torsional energy -- the energy required to rotate to a certain conformation
* Conformational analysis -- study of the energetics of different combinations

## Butane
* Has gauche and anti configurations
  * gauche is 60 degrees between CH3
  * anti is 180 degrees between CH3
  * totally eclipsed is 0 between CH3
  * eclipsed is 120 ""
* totally eclipsed has the highest energy, anti has the least
* **Steric strain** -- where the two end methyl groups are so close together they experience repulsion (totally eclipsed)

## Higher Alkanes
* prefer anti and gauche configurations
* Usually draw them zigzag, as anti is the lowest

## Cycloalkanes
* many compounds are cyclic -- contain rings of atoms
* cycloalkanes -- alkanes that contain rings of carbon atoms
* Simple ones are named like acyclic alkanes, with the prefix cyclo
  * cyclobutane -- 4 carbon ring
* CnH2n
* Physical properties -- boiling/melting point go up as # of carbons increases, and odd numbers have lower melting points
* Naming
  * No numbering is needed with one substituent
  * When more than one, naming is done with the lowest carbon first
* cis-trans -- substituents on the ring, pretty easy

## Stabilities of Cycloalkanes
* angle strain -- when a cycloalkane requires bond angles othr than 109.5 (Baeyer strain)
  * e.g. butane's 90 degree angles are ridiculous
* ring strain -- the angle strain coupled with torsional strain resulting from eclipsed bonds
* heat of combustion -- allows us to compare the ring strain when comparing with cyclohexane

### Cyclopropane
* cyclopropane requires 60 degree angles
* torsional strain also greatly contributes to the high energy

### Cyclobutane
* Total ring strain is almost as much as cyclopropane, but it is distributed over 4 atoms
* 88 degree, not 90, to reduce the torsional strain

### Cyclopentane
* "envelope" configuration to reduce the eclipsing

### Cyclohexane
* Chair conformation -- stable model
* boat conformation -- also has 109.5 and reduces angle strain
  * suffers from torsional strain due to eclipsing of bonds
  * hydrogens at the end of the "boat" are called flagpole hydrogens
  * actually a skewed twist boat conformation
* half-chair conformation -- where the footrest of the chair is planar with the sides of the molecule
* chair less than twist boat less than boat less than half chair
* axial bonds -- where the bonds with hydrogen are parallel to the axis of the ring
* equatorial bonds -- where the bonds are pointing out of the ring

## Conformations of Monosubstituted Cyclohexanes
* Substituents on the ring can occupy either an axial or equatorial position
* Reactivity depends on axial or equatorial in many cases
* chair-chair-interconversion -- chair to boat to inverted chair. Allows conversion from axial to equatorial
* 1,3-diaxial interaction -- form of steric strain where axial substituent interferes with axial hydrogens on C3 and C5

## Conformations of Disubstituted Cyclohexanes
* diequatorial interactions are much more favorable than diaxial interactions
* substituents of different sizes -- energy difference for a larger group is greater than that for a smaller group
  * if both groups cannot be equatorial, the larger group should be equatorial
* tert-butyl groups are much less strained in equatorial positions

## Bicyclic Molecules
* Fused rings -- most common
* Bridged rings -- also commonm sharing 2 nonadjacent carbon atoms and one or more carbon atoms between them
* Spirocyclic -- two rings share one carbon atom, rare
* The bridge is named after the cyclo, like bicyclo[4.2.0] where there is a four carbon bridge, a two carbon bridge, and a zero carbon bridge linking the bridgeheads.

### cis and trans Decalin
* Decalin is the most common fused ring system
* Two cyclohexane fused -- decalin (10 carbons)
* cis is folded, trans is straight
* trans isomer is rather rigid
