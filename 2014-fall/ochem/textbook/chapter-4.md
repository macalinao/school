# Chapter 4 -- Chemical Reactions

## Introduction
* Halogenation -- substitution of a halogen for a hydrogen that can occur in the gas phase without a solvent
* Mechanism -- the step-by-step pathway from reactants to products
* Thermodynamics -- the energetics of the reaction at equilibrium
* Kinetics -- the variation of reaction rates with different conditions and concentrations of reagents

## Chlorination of Methane
* Heat or light interacts with methane and chlorine to produce chloromethane and hydrogen chloride
* The reaction can continue until all hydrogens have been replaced with chlorine
* Chlorine needs some form of energy to initiate it -- does not occur at room temperature in the absence of light
* Most effective wavelength -- blue color absorbed by chlorine gas
* High quantum yield -- many molecules are formed for every photon absorbed.

## The Free-Radical Chain REaction
* Chain reaction -- explains the chlorination of methane
* Steps
  1. Initiation -- generates a reactive intermediate
  2. Propagation steps -- reactive intermediate reacts with a stable molecule to form a product and anotehr reactive intermediate
  3. Termination steps -- Side reactions that destroy reactive intermediates, slowing or stopping the reaction
* First reaction is a substitution
* Blue light -- promotes generation of radicals
* Half arrows show the movement of single unpaired electrons
* Chlorine atom -- recative intermediate -- short-lived species that reacts as quickly as it is formed, due to its odd number of valence electrons
* Free radicals -- Species with unpaired electrons
  * Electron deficient -- lack an octet
* Propagation
  * Chlorine radical removes a hydrogen atom from methane -- it wants it
  * Second propagation step -- methyl radical reacts with chlorine molecule to form chloromethane
* Termination
  * When radicals collide with eachother or the wall, the reaction terminates.

## Equilibrium constants and free energy
* Thermodynamics -- branch of chemistry that deals with the energy changes accompanying chemical and physical transformations
* Equilibrium constant -- [C]^c[D]^d/[A]^a[B]^b
* Gibbs free energy -- the amount of energy available to do work
* Standard Gibbs free energy change -- the Gibbs free energy change at 25C and 1 atm

## Enthalpy and Entropy
* DeltaG = DeltaH - TDeltaS
* DeltaH is the heat of reaction
  * Endothermic -- positive
  * Exothermic -- negative
* Entropy -- disorder, the most favorable state of a reaction

## Bond-Dissociation Enthalpies
* Bond-dissociation enthalpy (BDE) -- the amount of enthalpy required to break a bond homolytically (each bond gets one electron)
  * Heterolytically -- one atom retains both electrons
* Homolytic cleavage forms free radicals
  * Constant
* Heterolytic cleavage (ionic cleavage) forms ions
  * Enthalpy depends on the solvent

## Kinetics and the Rate Equation
* Rate of a reaction -- measure of how fast the products appear and reactants disappear
* Rate equation -- relationship between the concentrations of the reactants and the observed reaction rate
* Rate constant -- we know dis
* Reaction order -- the sum of the orders of each thing (Exponent) we know this too..

## Activation Energy and the Temperature Dependence of Rates
* E_a -- activation energy
  * Minimum energy the molecules must have to overcome the repulsions between electron clouds when they collide
* This is all review

## Transition States
* The peaks of the graph are transition states -- the highest energy state in molecular collision that leads to reaction
* Intermediate -- intermediate compounds to get to the final one
* Reaction coordinate -- horizontal axis on a reaction-energy diagram
* Catalyst -- lowers activation energy

## Rates of multistep reactions
* The rate limiting step is the highest energy step of a multistep reaction
  * Determines the overall rate of reaction

## Temperature Dependence of Halogenation
* Fluorine > Cl > Br > I in reaction rates
* Higher temperature yields faster reaction rates

## Selectivity in Halogenation
* Replacement of hydrogen atoms by chlorine is not random
  * It wants to substitute a higher degree hydrogen
* Bromine is much more selective

## Hammond Postulate
* Related species that are closer in energy are also closer in structure. The structure of a transition state resembles the structure of the closest stable species.
* E.Z.

## Radical Inhibitors
* Inhibit radical reaction chains... doh!
* Vitamin E and C are thought to be inhibitors
* Protect the cells of living systems

## Reactive Intermediates
* Short-lived species that react as quickly as they are formed
* Carbocation, free radical, carbanion, carbene are some
* Memorize the chart and you are fine. Also do some practice problems.
