# Chapter 4 -- Chemical Reactions

## Introduction
* Halogenation -- substitution of a halogen for a hydrogen that can occur in the gas phase without a solvent
* Mechanism -- the step-by-step pathway from reactants to products
* Thermodynamics -- the energetics of the reaction at equilibrium
* Kinetics -- the variation of reaction rates with different conditions and concentrations of reagents

## Chlorination of Methane
* Heat or light interacts with methane and chlorine to produce chloromethane and hydrogen chloride
* The reaction can continue until all hydrogens have been replaced with chlorine
* Chlorine needs some form of energy to initiate it -- does not occur at room temperature in the absence of light
* Most effective wavelength -- blue color absorbed by chlorine gas
* High quantum yield -- many molecules are formed for every photon absorbed.

## The Free-Radical Chain REaction
* Chain reaction -- explains the chlorination of methane
* Steps
  1. Initiation -- generates a reactive intermediate
  2. Propagation steps -- reactive intermediate reacts with a stable molecule to form a product and anotehr reactive intermediate
  3. Termination steps -- Side reactions that destroy reactive intermediates, slowing or stopping the reaction
* First reaction is a substitution
* Blue light -- promotes generation of radicals
* Half arrows show the movement of single unpaired electrons
* Chlorine atom -- recative intermediate -- short-lived species that reacts as quickly as it is formed, due to its odd number of valence electrons
* Free radicals -- Species with unpaired electrons
  * Electron deficient -- lack an octet

### Propagation steps
* Chlorine radical removes a hydrogen atom from methane -- it wants it
* Second propagation step -- methyl radical reacts with chlorine molecule to form chloromethane
