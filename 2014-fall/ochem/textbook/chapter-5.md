## Introduction
* Stereochemistry -- study of 3d structure of molecules
* Consitutitional isomers -- differ in bonding sequence
* Stereoisomers -- same bonding sequence, different orientation of atoms in space

## Chirality
* **chiral** -- objects that have left and right handed forms
* **achiral** -- not chiral, possesses a mirror image
* **superimposable** -- two molecules are this if they can be placed on top of each other and 3-d position of the atom coincides with the atom of the otehr molecule
* **enantiomers** -- nonsuperimposable mirror-image molecules
* **asymmetric carbon atom** -- carbon that is chiral, also called a chiral carbon atom
* **chirality center** -- term for any atom holding a set of ligands in aspatial arrangement that is not superimposable on its mirror image
* **sterocenter** -- an atom where the interchange of two groups gives a stereoisomer
* **internal mirror plane** -- plane in which an atom is symmetrical. No chiral compounds have this.
* non-chiral carbon atom -- when two of the four groups on a carbon atom are the same
* Summary
  * No chiral carbon -- achiral
  * one chiral carbon -- chiral
  * two or more chiral carbon -- use the mirror image

## (R), (S) nomenclature
* Chiral carbon has two possible spatial arrangements, with only one being biologically active
* Enantiomers must have diferent names
* Alanine and its enantiomer -- unnatural alanine not used
* Configuration around the chiral carbon is specified with (R) and (S)
* Cahn-Ingold-Prelog Rules
  * Assign a priority number to each group attached to the chiral carbon
  * Highest atomic number -- priority #1
  * Ties -- look at next atoms along the chain
  * Double/triple bonds are treated like bonds to duplicate atoms
  * Higher atomic number == higher priority
  * Look down the chain in case of ties
* (R) is clockwise, (S) is cclockwise

## Properties of Enantiomers
* Same boiling point, melting point, density
* Same refractive index
* Different direction of rotation in polarimeter
* Different interaction with other chiral molecules
  * Eg. taste buds, scent, enzymes

## Polarimetry
* Optical activity -- the rotation of the plane of polarized light
* Distinguish enantiomers by seeing how the plane of light shines through thecompound
* Polarimetry -- Clockwise is dextrorotary and counterclockwise is levorotatory
 
## Racemic mixtures
* Solution of an equal amount of d and l enantiomers
* (d,l) pair or (+-) pair
* no optical activity
* Mixture may have different bp and mp from enantiomers
* If optically inactive reagents combine to form a chiral molecule, a racemic mixture of enantiomers is formed
