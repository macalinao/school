* Don't break a carbon fluorine bond. it is very strong.

## Sn1 reaction
* Unimolecular nucleophilic substitution
* Carbocation intermediate
* rate = k[alkyl halide]
  * If i give you an alkyl halide, let's say CH3CH2Br -- NaSCH3 --> Sn2
    * Any time you have a negative charge on a species, you need to know it is a strong nucleophile
    * Sodium/potassium/lithium reagent -- strong nucleophile
  * CH3OH ---> SN1
* Racemization occurs

## Sn1 Mechanism
* Step 1 -- formation of carbocation
* Step 2 -- attack on nucleophile

## Rates of Sn1 Reactions
* Order of reactivity follows stability of carbocations (opposite of Sn2)

## Solvation Effect
* Polar protic solvent -- can solvate both ions strongly through hydrogen bonding

## Structure of the Carbocation
* sp2 hybridized and trigonal planar
* Lobes ar eon both sides of the trigonal plane
* Nucleophilic attack can occur from either siide


## Rearrangements
* Hydride shift -- H- on adjacent carbon moves
* Methyl shift -- CH3- on adjacent carbon moves
