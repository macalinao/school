## Fischer Projections
* flat drawing representing a 3d molecule
* chiral carbon at intersection
* horizontal is forward
* vertical is behind the plane
* assign R and S by looking at the atoms directly attached to the chiral carbon
* assign priority to the atoms
* after you figure out priority you draw an imaginary circly
* R is clockwise, s is counterclokwise assuming the lowest priority is in the back
* Chiral == 4 different substituents attached to the carbon 

## Fischer Rules
* Carbon chain on vertical line
* Highest oxidized carbon at the top
* Don't rotate 90 -- only 180 is allowed

## Fischer R and S
* Usually backwords, as H is usually forwards (horizontal)
* Mirror planes of symmetry

## Fischer man
* Rotating 180 degrees gives you the same molecule
* So if you can rotate 180 a fischer, it is the same molecule

## Diastereomers
* Stereoisomers that are not mirror images -- not enantiomers

## Two or more chiral carbons
* A compound with **n** chiral carbons might have as many as **2^n** stereoisomers
* Meso compounds -- have chiral centers but the molecule is not chiral
* Could be enantiomer, diastereomer, or meso.
* Assign R or S to each chiral carbon -- makes things easy.
* Swap R/S for enantiomers
* diastereomers -- flip one of the chiral carbons

## Meso compounds
* All have an internal plane of symmetry
* flip 180 and it is the same!

## Comparing structures workflow
* Structures the same?
  * Yes -- are they mirror images?
    * Yes -- Enantiomers
    * No -- is there a plane of symmetry?
      * Yes -- meso
      * No -- Diastereomers
  * No -- constitutional isomers

## Diastereomeric Interactions
* They can have vastly different properties
* Enantiomers of limonene -- cause different odors
