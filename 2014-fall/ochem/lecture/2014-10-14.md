* Tertiary alkyl halide -- no Sn2 reactions, but Sn1 and E1 (mostly Sn1)
* Carbocation == methyl sfity

## E2 Reaction
* Elimination reactions
* 3rd degree is most reactive

## Examples
* 1-bromohexane + NaOEt in EtOH
  * 1st degree. SN2.
* 2-chlorohexane + NaOCH3 in CH3OH
  * 2nd degree. NaOCH3 ~ strong base
* 2-chloro-2-methylbutane + naOEt in EtOH
  * 3rd degree
  * We see the chloro so it's E2
* 2-chloro-2-methylbutane in hot EtOH
  * 3rd degree
  * Preferred product is an E2 when you heat up, but it's SN1
* Isobutyl iodide + KOH in ethanol/water
  * wtffff

## E2 Stereochemistry
* The halide and the proton to be abstracted must be ANTICOPLANAR to each other for the elimination to occur
* Orbitals of hydrogen atom and halide must be aligned
* so on the newman projection, the H and X have to be opposite
