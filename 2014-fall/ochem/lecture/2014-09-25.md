## Free radicals
* Chlorine molecule splits homolytically into chlorine atoms (free radicals).
* Use half of the arrow to represent movement of one electron.
* Draw the single electron, not the lone pairs.

## Propagation
* The radical will be generated after heat or light
* Chlorine doesn't want to be alone, so it grabs a hydrogen from methane to create a methyl radical and HCl.
* second: Methyl radical use the half arrow to indicate the movement of the methyl radical's ion reacting with a chlorine molecule to end up with chloromethane
* This continues to react

## Termination
* When the methyl radical combines with a chlorine radical, it terminates because the electrons match up
* Radical + radical = terminated

## Enthalpy
* Exothermic is -H
* Endothermic is +H

## Bond-Dissociation Enthalpies
* Break bond is positive BDE
* Form bond is -BDE

## Cleavage
* Homolytic -- BDE
* Heterolytic -- Results in ions

## Rate law -- we know that already

## Interpret reaction charts -- we also know that

## Rate
* F most reactive, then Cl, then Br, then I (very unreactive)

## Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Hydrogens
* Primary = 3H, Secondary = 2H, Tertiary = 1H

## Chlorination mechanism
* Initiation -- split chloringe molecule
* First propagation step -- remove primary/secondary hydrogen
* Second propagation step -- form alkyl chloride by reacting the radical with chlorine
