## Intro
* Look for the eclipsed structure and staggered one if you need to rank based off of stability.
* The staggered one is the one you want to look at. This is important.
* Staggered is more stable than the eclipsed conformation where the bond angle is less than 60 degrees. 

## Cyclohexane
* 1,3 diaxial interaction -- main reason to cause the structure to be very unstable
* Consider these interactions
* Look for the ones that have the diaxial interaction -- have the big substituent in the axial position
* Equatorial position is the sable one. You want to have the big compounds in equatorial, this is the most stable.
* Chair conformation is the most important structure to know.
* t-Butyl has to be in the equatorial position. It is very big, it is very bulky, if you oput it on the axial then you have a lot of strain because of the 1,3 diaxial interaction. 99% of the time t-Butyl will be in the equatorial, not the axial!!

## Finish Chapter 3
* Bicyclic system -- fused ring system
* You have to know how to name cyclic systems. Bicyclic systems are very easty to name
* When they fuse together, you add "bicyclo" to the naming.
* In the structuure you count the total number of carbon in the tructure on the left ring, the right ring, then the bridge.
* So two cyclohexanes fused would be bicyclo[4,4,0]decane.
* bicyclic system is all about nomenclature -- we don;t talk about it now
* You have the bridge in the carbon. It's just the naming
* The numbering syste is very simple.
* Check the carbon you have on each side, put them in alphabetical order, and simple.

# Chapter 5 -- Stereochemistry
* The most difficult chapter!!!! UH OH
* This is what the model kit is for. **You can bring the model kit to the exam**
* In this chapter we are going to be talking a lot about the enantiomers.
* diastereomers have cis-trans and other diastereomers.

## Chirality
* Chiral object has a mirror-image that is different from the original obhject
* Non-superimposable. You cannot put them on top of each other.
* When you put the chair in the mirror, they are not chiral.
* It's all about the mirror image. A non-superimposable mirror image is chiral.
* They are DIFFERENT.
* Enantiomer pair -- two chiral molecules in a pair.
