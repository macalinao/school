## Resonance structures
* Lewis structures that can be interconverted by moving electrons only
* True structure is a hybrid, resulting in delocalization of charge
* Use curved arrows to show movement of electrons
* Nitrogen follows the octet rule -- never put 10 electrons on it despite 5 valence
* Major is most stable, minor is least stable and much of the time does not exist
* Most electronegative atom is the major contributor
* Non-equivalent resonance -- the most stable one is the one with the smallest charge separation
* Octet rule -- most important rule, as many bonds as possible, second rule

## Acids/Bases
* Electronegativity increasing causes pKa to decrease
* Size increasing also causes pKa to decrease
* Resonance decreases pKa -- makes the conjugate base more stable
* Inductive Effect -- electron withdrawing atoms/groups can stabilize a conjugate base
  * e.g. Chlorine stabilizes the conjugate base when it is closer to the group
