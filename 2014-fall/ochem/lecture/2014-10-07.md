* Sn2 mechanism
  * Rate depends on both the concentrations of alkyl halide and nucleophile
  * Bimolecular nucleophilic substitution
* Sn2 energy diagram
  * Sn2 is one step reaction
  * Transition state is highest in energy

## Factors affecting Sn2 reactions
* Strong nucleophiles react faster
* Strong bases are strong nucleophiles, but not all strong nucleophiles are basic

## Basicity vs Nucleophilicity
* Basicity -- equilibrium constant for abstracting a proton
* Nucleophilicity -- rate of attack on the electrophilic carbon atom

## Trends in nucleophilicity
* Steric hindrance (bulkiness) hinders nucleophicity more than it hinders basicity
* Negatively charged stronger than neutral
* Decreases from left to right
* Increases down periodic table, as size/polarizability increase

## Polarizability effect
* Bigger atoms have a soft shell -- overlap carbon atom from farther distance
* Thus more nucleophilic

## Solvent Effects: Protic solvents
* Acidic hydrogens solvating the nucleophile, reducing nucleophilicity

## Solvent Effects: Aprotic solvents
* polar aprotic solvents:  No acidic protons -- cannot hydrogen bond
* Sn2 reactions are faster in these kinds of solvents

## Leaving Group Ability
* Best leaving groups:
  * Electron-withdrawing to polarize carbon atom
  * Stable once they have left
  * Polarizable to stabilize transition state
  * Never write SN2 reactions showing hydroxide, alkoxide, or other strong bases serving as leaving groups
* Relative rates for Sn2: CH3X > 1 > 2 > > 3
  * tertiary halides do not react via sn2 due to steric hindrance

## Steric effects of structore on Sn2 reactions
* Nucleophile aoproaches from back
* Most overlap back lobe of C-X sp3 orbital
  * t-butyl -- impossible to protonate

## Back side attack in the Sn2 reaction
* does it from behind

## Intramolecular Sn2
* Alcohol and sodium hydroxide -- rate is much faster than attacking carbons
