* sample space - all possible outcomes (represented by \Omega)
* events -- any set of actions (subset of \Omega)

## Chess match
* \Omega = { white wins, black wins, draw }
  * N = 3, so 2^3 = 8 possible events

## Disjoint
* mutually exclusive
* A intersects B = empty set

## Exhasutive
* Union of the events is \Omega

## Demorgan's
* Not (X or Y) = Not X and Not Y
* Not (X and Y) = Not X or Not Y
