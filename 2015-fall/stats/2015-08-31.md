## Permutations without replacement
P(n, k) = n!/(n - k)!

NP problem (non-polynomial problem)

## Combinations without replacement

n choose k

n!/k!(n - k)!

### Example

If picking 6 computers from 20 (15 normal and 5 refurbished), what is the probability that 2 are refurbished

(15 C 4)(5 C 2)

## Combinations with replacement

Each item can be sampled 0 or more times.

C_r(n, k) = (k + n - 1) C k = (k + n - 1)!/(k!(n - 1)!)

## Conditional probability

P(B | A) = P(A intersects B) / P(A)

| = given. so A | B means probability of A given B has occured

## Bayes rule
P(A | B) = (P(B | A) P(A)) / P(B)

## Law of total probability

P(B) = P((B int A) u (B int !A)) = P(B int A) + P(B int !A)
     = P(B | A)P(A) + P(B | !A)P(A)

mutually exclusive

## Bayes Rule for two events

P(B | A) = P(A | B)P(B) / [ P(S | V)P(V) + P(S | !V)P(!V) ]
