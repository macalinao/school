## Axioms of probability
* Given a sample space \Omega
* A sigma-algebra is a collection of events such that:
  * \Omega element of M
  * If Event element of M, then complement of Event element of M
  * If E1, E2, ..., element of M then E1 union E2 union ... element of M

### Ex
\Omega = { a, b, c }

Give some examples of sigma algebras

#### events
empty set, {a}, {b}, {c}, {a, b}, {b, c}, {a, c}, {a, b, c}

Sigma algebrae
* 2^\Omega = "power set"
* M = { empty set, {a, b, c} }

## Probability is a function
P : M --> [ 0, 1 ]

such that

P(\Omega) = 1

If E1, E2, ... is a list (finite or countable) of mutually exclusive events then

P(E1 union E2 union ...) = P(E1) + P(E2) + ...

## P(empty set)
Since P(\Omega) = 1,

1 = P(\Omega) = P(\Omega union empty set) = P(\Omega) + P(empty set) = 1 + P(empty set)

thus

P(empty set) = 0

## Event
If E is an event consists of mutually exclusive outcomes E= {a1, a2, a3, ...}

P(E) = P(a1) + P(a2) + P(a3) + ...

Ex. Suppose the probabilities of getting each grade in a certain course are:
A 0.15
B 0.25
C 0.30
D 0.18
F 0.12

What is the probability of getting a C or better?
E = { A, B, C }

P(E) = P(A) + P(B) + P(C) = 0.15 + 0.25 + 0.30 = 0.70

## Ex
Sps there are 70 students -- 15 drama, 5 chess, of these 3 are in both

What is the prob that...

student in chess club?

P(C) = 5/70 = 1/14

student in drama club?

P(D) = 15/70 = 3/14

student in chess or drama club?

P(C union D) = P(C) + P(D) - P(C intersect D) = 17/70

## intermission

## Application: Reliability
* "parallel" -- union + mut. excl -- at least one
* "sequentially" -- intersection * independent -- all must fire

## Independence
events E1, E2, ..., En

P(E1 int E2 int ... int En) = P(E1) * P(E2) * ... * P(En)

P({saved}) = 1 - P({lost}) complement rule
           = 1 - P(H int B int B2)
           = 1 - P(H) * P(B1) * P(B2) independence
           = 1 - (0.01)(0.02)(0.02) = 1 - 0.00004 = 0.999996
