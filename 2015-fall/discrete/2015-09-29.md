## Rec Def for full binary tree

### Basis Step

A single vertex is a full binary tree.

### Rec. Step

If $T_1$ & $T_2$ are disjoint full binary trees, then the tree $T = T_1 \cdot T_2$ consisting of a new root $r$, together with edges connecting $r$ to the roots of the left subtree $T$, and the right subtree $T_2$ is a full binary tree.

## Rec Def for $h(T)$ the height of a full binary tree $T$.

### Basis step

The height of the full binary tree $T$ consisting of only a root is $h(T) - 0$.

### Rec. step

If $T_1$ & $T_2$ are full binary trees with heights $h(T_1)$ and $h(T_2)$, resp., then the full binary tree $T = T_1 \cdot T_2$ has height $h(T) = 1 + max(h(T_1), h(T_2))$.

## Rec def of $n(T)$ the number of vertices in a full binary tree $T$.

### Basis Step

The number of vertices in a full binary tree $T$ consisting of only a root is $n(T) = 1$.

### Rec. step

If $T_1$ and $T_2$ are full binary trees with $n(T_1)$ and $n(T_2)$ vertices resp. then the full binary tree $T = T_2 \cdot T_2$ has $n(T) = 1 + n(T_1) + n(T_2)$.
