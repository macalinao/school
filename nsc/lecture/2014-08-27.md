## Three kinds of neurons - anatomy
* **unipolar neurons** - a single extension that branches in two directions, forming a receptive pole and an output zone
* **bipolar neurons** - one axon, one dendrite -- usually sensory
* **multipolar neurons** - one axon, many dendrites -- most common type

Different types of neurons have different functions. Computers don't have the same kinds of problems as neurons.
For a sensory system, you'd want a unipolar neuron as it's the fastest neuron. It goes straight through.
* Unipolar -- representation does not matter. Unipolar is the *most reliable* transmitting neuron.

Multipolar will allow you to get information from all parts of the brain. *The brain is primarily composed of multipolar neurons*.

Bipolar are pretty useless. There is one part that uses it: **the eye**.

## Four zones of a neuron
* Input zone - neurons collect and integrate information either form the environment or forom other cells
* Integration zone - decision to produce a neural signal is made
* Conduction zone - information over long distances
* Output zone - neuron transfers information to other cells

Cell boody is in input and integration for multipolar and bipolar.
In monopolar the cell body is in the conduction zone.

## Three kinds of neurons - function
* Sensory neurons - respond to environment, such as light, odor, or touch
* Motoneurons - contact muscles or glands
* Interneurons - receive input from and send input to other neurons -- integration

```
Sense -> Inter -> Motor
eye       CNS     PNS
```
CNS = central nervous system
PNS = peripheral nervous system

**Glial Cells** -- support the brain
Below are 4 types:
* astrocytes
* oligodendrocytes
* ependymal cells
* microglia

Glial cells are very important in brain disorders. Migraine -- reason is a glial cell.

### Astrocytes
* Attached to a capillary and a neuron. Serves as the liason between the blood vessel and the neuron.
* Looks like a star, hence being called an astrocyte
* Most numerous glial cell in the brain
* Fills spaces between neurons for support
  * Keeps the neurons in place
* Regulate composition of the extracellular space

You need a very precise distance between neurons, like spark plugs. Astrocytes keep the brain's cells in the correct positions.

#### Case
Astrocyte - oma(tumor)
This guy got headaches because of astrocytoma.
Medulla lets you breathe. The tumor causes the medulla to die.

#### Rolf
15 month old boy admitted for continual screaming, vomiting, and enlarging head
The center of the brain is white but the outer part is not ok.
He deteriorated and died 3 weeks later.

Alexander's disease -- astrocytes fill up with GFAP, then fail

### Oligodendrocytes
Wrap axons with myelin sheaths inside brain and spinal cord.
