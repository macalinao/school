* Ochem is the chemistry of carbon compunds
* Carbon forms strong bonds n
* Not all carbon compoinds are organic
  * eg graphite, diamond, C60 ball, carbon nanotube
  * Behaves like a chemical compound, not a normal organic material
* Learn about the location of electrons
* Ochem is all about **what electrons do** and how they behave
* We already know many of these concepts from chemistry
* Pauli exclusion principle - only 2 electorns can be placed in each orbital
* Only care about the first 2 shells of the orbitals in ochem -- first 2 rows of the periodic table contain the majority of the leements in organic compounds
* First shell is spherically symmetrical
* nodal plane in the middle -- separates the electron regions. node has no electrons.
* Aufbau principle - place electrons in lowrest energy orbitals first.
* Hund's rule - eectrons will go into different orbitals rather than pairing up when they are degenerate orbitals
* ionization energy - energy required to remove an electron
* Electropositive -- an atom that readily loses an electron to leave an atom with a complete outer shell, e.g. lithium
* covalent bonding most common in ochem
* CH3CN is a triple bond
* CH3COOH -- CO double bond and the OH is an alcohol part (also CO2H)
* Line Angle drawings - omit carbon and hydrogen
  * Put deviants from the normal structure in parentheses
* bond length can become a vector, for the dipole moment = charge separation times bond length
* EPM - electrostatic potential map -- shows charge separation
* carbon hydrogen bonds are effectively non polar
* Memorize first 3 rows of the periodic table
* Resonance structures - can be interconverted by moving electrons only
