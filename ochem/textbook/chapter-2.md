# Chapter 2 Notes

## Wave Properties of Electrons in Orbitals
* There are two general kinds of waves: traveling waves and standing waves.
* An orbital is a 3-d standing wave.
* **Wave function** (psi) - mathematical description of the shape of the wave as it vibrates
* All of the wave is positive in sign for a brief instant; then it is negative in sign.
* Electron density at any point is given by (psi)^2, square of the wave function
* Plus/minus sign is not the charge, but the *phase* of the function.
* 1s orbital is spherically symetrical and normally represented by a circle
* Node -- where the displacement is always zero
* Out of phase -- when the waves are unsynchronized
  * e.g. 2p orbital -- when one has a plus sign, the other has a minus sign
* **Linear combination of atomic orbitals** (LCAO) - Combining wave functions of atomic orbitals
  * When orbitals on different atoms interact, they produce **molecular orbitals** that lead to [anti]bonding interactions
  * When orbitals on the same atom interact, they give **hybrid atomic orbitals** that define bond geometry

## Molecular Orbitals
* Covalent bond stability results from large electron density in the bonding region
  * **Bonding region** -- space between the two nuclei
  * Electrons are close to both nuclei, lowering the overall energy (stabilizing)
  * Bonding electrons mask the positive charges of the nuclei, so the nuclei don't repel each other as much
    * Kind of like electron shielding
* There is an optimal distance for the nuclei
  * Too far, attraction diminished
  * Too close, repulsion pushes them apart
  * **Bond length** -- internuclear distance where attraction and repulsion are balanced

## The Hydrogen Molecule; Sigma Bonding
* Hydrogen is the simplest example of covalent bonding (H2)
* Hydrogen 1s wave functions can add *constructively* to reinforce each other, or *destructively* so they cancel out when they overlap
* **Bonding molecular orbital** -- where the wave functions reinforce each other and increase the electron density in the bonding region
* Most electrons in H-H are along the line connecting the nuclei
* **Sigma bond** -- cylindrally symmetrical bond
* Most common bonds in organic compounds
* All single bonds in organic compounds are sigma bonds, and double/triple bonds contain one sigma bond
* Highest electron density is in the bonding region
* **Constructive interaction** -- the two orbitals are in phase nad have the same sign, so they reinforce each other
* **Destructive interaction** -- antibonding molecular orbital results when orbitals overlap out of phase with each other
  * Antibonding is designated by an asterisk
  * Antibonding orbitals are usually vacant in stable molecules
  * often participate in reactions
* **Pi bond** -- overlap between two perpendicularly oriented p orbitals

## Single and Double Bonds
* **Double bond** -- requires the presence of 4 bonding electrons
* Pi bond is not as strong as most sigma bonds
* **Hybrid atomic orbitals** -- most common types of bonding orbitals in organic compounds

## Hybridization and Molecular Shapes
* **VSEPR Theory** -- a common way for accounting bond angles.
* electron pairs repel each other, and bonds and lone pairs are separated by the largest possible angles.
* 109.5 is the angle for 4 pairs of electrons
* 120 is largest for 3 pairs
* 180 is largest for 2 pairs
* Shapes do not result from simple s and p orbital bonding -- s and p are not the best for bonds
* S and p ortibtals form hybrid atomic orbitals that separate electron pairs more widely in space
* Hybrids place more electron density in the bonding region between nuclei

## sp Hybrid Orbitals
* **sp hybrid orbital** -- orbital resulting from a p and s orbital on the same atom
* linear bonding arrangement

## sp2 Hybrid Orbitals
* Composed of one s and two p orbitals
* 120 arrangement -- trigonal geometry

## sp3 Hybrid Orbitals
* Tetrahetral arrangement -- combine s with 3 p orbitals
* 109.5 arrangement -- tetrahedral geometry

## Drawing 3-dimensional molecules
* 3d structure of ethane has the shape of 2 tetrahedra joined together
* Each carbon atom is sp3 hybridized
* bond angles are 109.5
* dashed lines go into the page, wedge shaped go out of the page

## General Rules of Hybridization and Geometry
* **Rule 1.** -- Both sigma bonding electrons and lone pairs can occupy hybrid orbitals. The number of hybrid orbitals on an atom is computed by adding the number of sigma bonds and the number of lone pairs of electrons on that atom.
* **Rule 2.** -- Use the hybridization and geometry that give the widest possible separation of the calculated number of bonds and lone pairs.
* **Rule 3.** -- If two or three pairs of electrons form a multiple bond between two atoms, the first bond is a sigma bond formed by a hybrid orbital. The second bond is a pi bond, consisting of two lobes above and below the sigma bond, formed by two unhybridized p orbitals. The third bond is another pi bond perpendicular to the first pi bond.

Pretty simple. Just do the practive problems.

## Bond Rotation

### Rotation of Single Bonds
* Ethane -- both carbon atoms are sp3 hybridized and tetrahedral.
* **Conformations** -- different structures differing only in rotations about a single bond.
* A single sigma bond allows free rotation.

### Rigidity of Double Bonds
* Ethylene, for example, is very rigid
* Pi bonds need overlap, and twisting one of the CH2 groups in ethylene loses the overlap
* P orbitals cannot overlap when the two ends of the molecule are at right angles, so the pi bond is broken in this geometery.

## Isomerism
* **Isomers** -- different compounds with the same molecular formula
* **Constitutional (structural) isomers** -- differ in their bonding sequence; atoms are connected differently
  * Can differ in branching of carbon chain
  * Can also differ in the position of a double bond or other group or by having a ring or some other feature
* **Stereoisomers** -- Differ only in how their atoms are oriented in space
  * Atoms are bonded in the same order
  * Differ in the spatial orientation of the groups attached to the double bond
  * **Stereochemistry** -- the study of the structure and chemistry of stereoisomers
  * **Cis-trans (geometric) isomers** -- differ in the geometry of the groups on a double bond; a type of stereoisomer
    * as in, the chains are flipped across a multiple bond
    * There must be two different groups on each end of the double bond -- a hydrogen on each side of the double bond does not count if it is flipped

## Polarity of Bonds and Molecules

### Bond Dipole Moments
* mu (bond dipole moment) = delta (amount of charge at either end of the dipole) x d (distance between the charges)
* **Debye** -- unit of dipole moment, where 1 debye = 3.34x10^-30 coulomb meters
* If a proton and electron were 1 angstrom apart, the dipole moment would be:
  * mu = 1.60x10^-19 coulomb * 10^-10 meter = 1.60*10^-29 coulomb meter
  * in debyes, 4.8 D
* A simple rule of thumb: mu = 4.8 x delta (electron charge) x d (in angstroms)
* In organic compounds, bond dipole moments range from zero in symmetrical bonds to about 3.6D for the C-N triple bond

### Molecular Dipole Moments
* **Molecular dipole moment** -- dipole moment of the molecule taken as a whole
* Good indicator of a molecule's overall polarity
* Can be measured directly, in contrast to bond dipole moments which are estimated by comparing various compounds
* Equal to the vector sum of the individual bond dipole moments -- reflects magnitude and direction
* Formaldehyde has a strongly polar C=O bond, and CO2 has two, but CO2 is non polar due to the symmetry of the molecule
* C-H bonds are pretty much nonpolar -- dipole moment is insignificant
* Tetrahedral symmetry of CCl4 causes the dipole moments to cancel
* Lone pairs contribute to dipole moments as well

## Intermolecular forces

### Dipole-Dipole Forces
* attractive intermolecular forces resulting from the attraction of the positive and negative ends of the dipole moments of polar molecules
* results in larger heats of vaporization and higher boiling points for strongly polar compounds

### London Dispersion Force
* Principal attractive force in nonpolar molecules
* One of the **van der Waals forces**
* Arises from temporary dipole moments induced in a molecule by other nearby molecules
* Electrons are not always evenly distributed even though there is no permanent dipole moment (nonpolar)
* Small dipole moment is induced when one molecule approaches a non-symmetrical electron-wise molecule
* There is a slight displacement of electrons so an attractive dipole-dipole interaction results
* Dipole interactions last a fraction of a second, but the net force is attractive
* Proportional to the molecular surface area -- depends on close surface contact of two molecules
* CCl4 has a greater surface area than CCl3H (chloroform), so the London dispersion forces are stronger
* **Isomers** with larger surface area have the higher boiling points

### Hydrogen Bonding
* Not a true bond, but a very strong dipole-dipole interaction
* Applies to O-H, N-H, and H-F (inorganic) bonds
* Strongly polar bonds, leaving hydrogen with a partial positive charge
* Much weaker than a normal C-H, N-H, or O-H covalent bond
* Breaking a hydrogen bond requires about 20 kJ/mol, as opposed to 400kJ/mol for a C-H/N-H/O-H bond
* Has a large effect on physical properties of compounds -- greatly increases boiling point (dimethyl ether vs ethanol)
* Alcohols form stronger hydrogen bonds than amines, due to oxygen being more electronegative than nitrogen
