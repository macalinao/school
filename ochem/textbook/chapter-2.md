# Chapter 2 Notes

## Wave Properties of Electrons in Orbitals
* There are two general kinds of waves: traveling waves and standing waves.
* An orbital is a 3-d standing wave.
* **Wave function** (psi) - mathematical description of the shape of the wave as it vibrates
* All of the wave is positive in sign for a brief instant; then it is negative in sign.
* Electron density at any point is given by (psi)^2, square of the wave function
* Plus/minus sign is not the charge, but the *phase* of the function.
* 1s orbital is spherically symetrical and normally represented by a circle
* Node -- where the displacement is always zero
* Out of phase -- when the waves are unsynchronized
