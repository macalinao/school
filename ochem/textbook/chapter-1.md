## Resonance
* Resonance structure / resonance form -- differs in electron placement
* The molecule is considered a resonance hybrid -- a resonance hybrid contains resonance structures
* Delocalized -- spread out
  * refers to the positive charge. It is delocalized over the carbon and nitrogen in the example
  * [H2CNH2]+ has the positive charge delocalized
* Resonance-stabilized cation -- a cation with a delocalized positive charge
  * Makes the ion more stable
  * Resonance is most important when it allows delocalization of a charge
* Resonance stabilization is crucial in double bonded compounds and the whole concept of ochem
* Acidity of acetic acid is enhanced by resonance effects
  * Losing a proton, acetate ion has a delocalized negative charge, stabilizing the ion
* **Bond order** - the number of bonds in a bond (e.g. single bond = 1, double bond = 2)
* Acetic acid is CH3CO2H. So deprotoning it removes the H, allowing resonance.
* Equilibrium is represented by the arrows
* They do not resonate between the two forms; rather, they are delocalized at the same time
