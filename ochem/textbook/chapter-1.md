# Chapter 1 Notes

## Resonance
* Resonance structure / resonance form -- differs in electron placement
* The molecule is considered a resonance hybrid -- a resonance hybrid contains resonance structures
* Delocalized -- spread out
  * refers to the positive charge. It is delocalized over the carbon and nitrogen in the example
  * [H2CNH2]+ has the positive charge delocalized
* Resonance-stabilized cation -- a cation with a delocalized positive charge
  * Makes the ion more stable
  * Resonance is most important when it allows delocalization of a charge
* Resonance stabilization is crucial in double bonded compounds and the whole concept of ochem
* Acidity of acetic acid is enhanced by resonance effects
  * Losing a proton, acetate ion has a delocalized negative charge, stabilizing the ion
* **Bond order** - the number of bonds in a bond (e.g. single bond = 1, double bond = 2)
* Acetic acid is CH3CO2H. So deprotoning it removes the H, allowing resonance.
* Equilibrium is represented by the arrows
* They do not resonate between the two forms; rather, they are delocalized at the same time
* Some uncharged molecules have equal positive and negative formal charges

## Major/Minor Resonance Contributors
* Major contributor -- more stable resonance form
* Minor contributor -- less stable form
* The actual compounds resembled the major contributor more
* Formaldehyde for example can have a negative charge on oxygen and positive charge on carbon
  * Higher in estimated energy because it has charge separation, fewer bonds, and a positive carbon without an octet
  * Explains why the C=O bond on formaldehyde is very polar, with partial positive on carbon

### Resonance rules

1. All the resonance structures must be valid Lewis structures for the compounds.
2. Only the placement of the electrons may be shifted from one structure to the other.
3. The number of unpaired electrons (if any) must remain the same. Most stable compounds have no unpaired electrons, and all the electrons must remain paired in all the resonance forms.
4. The major resonance contributor is the one with the lowest energy. Good contributors generally have all octets satisfied, as many bonds as possible, and as little charge separation as possible. Negative charges are more stable on electronegative atoms, such as O, N, and S.
5. Resonance stabilization is most important when it serves to delocalize a charge over two or more atoms.

### Criteria in order

1. As many octets as possible
2. As many bonds as possible
3. Any negative charges on electronegative atoms
4. As little charge separation as possible

## Structural Formulas
* Show which atoms are bonded to which
* Two types -- Lewis and Condensed
* Condensed - written without showing all of the individual bonds

## Line-Angle Formulas
* Easy.

## Molecular Formulas and Empirical Formulas
* molecular formula -- number of atoms of each element in one molecule of the compounds
* empirical formula -- the relative rations of the elements present

## Arrhenius acids and bases
* Acids dissociate in water to give hydronium ions.
* Bases dissociate in water to give hydroxide ions.

Kw = [H3O+][-OH] = 1E-14 M^2

## Bronsted-Lowry Acids and Bases
* Acid donates a proton
* Base accepts a proton

Generally:
* The stronger an acid, the weaker its conjugate base.
* The weaker an acid, the stronger its conjugate base.
* Acid-base reactions favor the weaker acid and the weaker base.

Resonance stabilizes molecules, so the proton will bond to the atom that gives the molecule more resonance structures.

### Acid Strength
Ka is the acid-dissociation constant , and its value indicates the relative strength of the acid.

### Structural effects on acidity
* Electronegativity positively correlates with acidity
* Size positively correlates with acidity
* Resonance stabilization
* Inductive effect -- electron-withdrawing atoms and groups can also stabilize a conjugate base via sigma bonds
  * Adding a chlorine atom to butanoic acid increases its acidity, for example
  * The closer the electronegative atom is bonded to the acid group, the lower the pKa.
  * Stabilizes the conjugate base
  * Stronger electron-withdrawing groups also stabilize the anion of the conjugate base, e.g. pKa of Cl > pKa of Cl3

## Lewis Acids and Bases
* Acid accepts electrons -- electrophile
* Base donates electrons -- nucleophile
* "phile" terminology is used for bond formation

* **Curved-arrow formalism** shows the flow of an electron pair from the electron *donor to acceptor*.
