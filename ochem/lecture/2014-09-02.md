## Lewis acids and bases
* Lewis bases -- donate electrons - nucleophile
* Lewis acids -- accept electrons - electophile
* Nucleophile attacks the electophile, so electron goes from negative to positive.

# Chapter 2

* Wave function describes size, shape, and orientation of a wave
* LCAO -- linear combination of atomic orbitals
* Electrons in the bonding region prevent the nuclei from repelling each other
* Sigma bonding - s-s overlap
* Orbitals can be constructive or destructive
* Destructive orbitals have a higher energy -- they are not as stable
* Cl2 -- p-p sigma bond overlap
* Pi bonding and antibonding -- sideways
* Most bonds are regular bonds. Antibonds occur when the electrons are excited.
* VSEPR -- explains shape of electrons
* sp hybrid orbitals -- one big lobe and one tiny lobe
* sp2 -- trigonal planar, one big lobe and one small lobe
* sp3 -- tetrahedral
