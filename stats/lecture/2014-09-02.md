* **Histogram** - Repeat quantitative data
  * Two types: density scale and frequency
  * Density scale -- each bar tells the % of data in each interval
* **Distribution table** - table of "quantity up to quantity", number, percent, and percent per unit
* Know mean and median
* Spread
  * Range -- difference between max and min
  * Standard deviation -- average distance between each observation and the mean, better measure
* Standard deviation
  * Variance -- average of distance between each ovservation and the mean of the data
    * Calculated by squaring each distance and taking the average of the squares
  * SD > 0, the more spread, the higher the SD
  * If all numbers are the same, SD = 0
  * Outliers do not affect much, due to it being the root mean square
* Percentiles and quartiles
  * **pth percentile (Q_p)** - number below which p proportion of the observations lie
  * Quartiles divide the data into 4 equal parts, Q1 is below 25%, Q2 is below 50%, Q3 is below 75%
* **IQR = Q3 - Q1** -- range of the middle half of the data (interquartile range)
* **Five number summary** - min, q1, q2, q3, max (boxplot)
* For skewed distributions, median and IQR are more appropriate than mean and SD
