* Box plot -- 5 points min q1 q2 q3 max
* Changes of scale affect measures
  * If X -> Y = aX + b, then:
  * X -> Y = aX + b
  * Medianx -> Mediany = aMedianx + b
  * Quartilex -> Quartiley = aQuartilex + b
  * SDx -> SDy = aSDx
  * IQRx -> IQRy = aIQRx
* Normal approximation for data
  * Many histograms can be modeled using normal distribution
  * They are symmetric and mean and sd can be modeled independently
  * Continuous
* 68-95-99.7% rule -- roughly 1sigma, 2sigma, and 3sigma
